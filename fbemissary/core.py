            on the dashboard.

        verify_token (str):

                The ID for a Facebook Page that your app is subscribed
                to, which the ``conversationalist_factory`` will handle
            page_access_token (str):
                The access token for the Facebook Page specified by
                the ``page_id``
            conversationalist_factory:
                A object with a coroutine method called
                ``make_conversationalist`` which supports four
                arguments and returns a "Conversationalist" object.
                The interfaces are described below.
            preinit_conversations (list of str):
                A list of counterpart IDs, used to pre-instantiate
                conversationalists

        Conversationalist Factories will have their
        ``make_conversationalist`` coroutine method be called with four
        arguments: an instance of
        :class:`fbemissary.client.ConversationReplierAPIClient` (for
        sending messages back to the user), the Facebook Page ID,
        the page-scoped ID of the conversation counterpart (the user on
        the other end of the conversation), and the event loop.
        As this method can be called during the processing of the
        webhook request from Facebook, it must complete quickly, or
        Facebook will abandon the attempt and try again.

        The factory's method coroutine must result in a
        Conversationalist object: an object with a
        ``handle_messaging_event`` method (not a coroutine!) that
        accepts a messaging event.

        A Conversationalist is an object that receives messaging
        events (described in the documentation for
        :mod:`fbemissary.models`) from a conversation with a single
        user and replies as needed.
